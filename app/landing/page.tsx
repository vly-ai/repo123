### Explanation:
1. **File Documentation**: The file starts with comprehensive documentation explaining its purpose, the functions it contains, the components it uses, and a brief description.
2. **Imports**: It imports the `Image` component from `next/image` for displaying an image and `Link` from `next/link` to create navigation links.
3. **Landing Component**: The main component is a functional component named `Landing`.
4. **Return JSX**: The component returns JSX code that structures the landing page with a heading, a description, an illustration, and two links (Sign Up and Log In).

The `main` tag ensures that the component takes up the full height of the screen, and the content is centered both vertically and horizontally. The `Image` component displays an illustration relevant to the task manager, and `Link` components are used for navigation to the Sign Up and Log In pages.
